Rob, thank you for the great article! It is in the air, this feeling that the foundations of the society of tomorrow are being laid out today, and I am sure you guys are the front-runners. I am trying to be part of it too, on a different scale, of course. Today, I put a demo on YouTube , showing a software update propagated through my private cloud with subsequent restart of the cloud participants. The demo is less than 2 minutes long. Please let me know if you think this work could be of use to you guys. See also:

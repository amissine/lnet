Hi! In this demo I will show you how the software update from this box gets propagated 
throughout the cloud. It is similar to what Apple does to our iPhones while we are
asleep, but in our case it is all open source, and there is no central point of origin
of the update - whichever box has the latest, it shares it with the rest of the cloud.

The cloud is depicted in the bottom-left corner of the screen. It runs on two boxes that
reside in Kiev, Ukraine, and 4 boxes residing here in Miami. In Miami, we have 4 leaves
connected to the local hub. In Kiev, we have one leaf connected to the local hub, 
and another leaf, "kiev-leaf0", connected to both the local hub and the hub in Miami.
This leaf serves as a bridge between the two hubs.

When the cloud starts, this leaf starts first. The other leaves follow, and the last
leaf to start is "mia-leaf3", the one that runs on this box and, incidentally, has the
latest and the greatest update. As soon as it starts, all other leaves pick up the
update and restart. The script that runs the demo is in the top-right corner of the
screen. Let us start it!
